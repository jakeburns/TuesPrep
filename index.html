  <li>One of the first ways he shows changes in data visualizations is by color. Red shows a decrease in a numerical value and green is used to show an increase.</li>
  <li>Where one or more continuous variables is used, he shows the change with a time series line chart. This chart allows you to easily see where some numerical data started and where it ended allowing for easy comprehension.</li>
  <li>Another way he mentions to show changes meaningully is to visual indexes. Presenting indexes to your reader allows for a clearer breakdown of the changes that have occured in your data.</li>
